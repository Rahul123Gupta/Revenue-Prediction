💰 Revenue Prediction Project

This project focuses on predicting future revenue for a business using historical sales and related features. It demonstrates my skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, machine learning modeling, and evaluation.

📖 About the Project

I created this project as part of my Data Science learning journey to understand how businesses forecast revenue and make strategic decisions based on data. The goal was to analyze historical data, build predictive models, and provide accurate revenue forecasts.

📊 Key Highlights

Performed Data Cleaning and Preprocessing using Pandas & NumPy

Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to find trends and patterns in revenue

Engineered important features to improve model performance

Built machine learning models including:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

Gradient Boosting Regressor

Evaluated models using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R² score

Visualized predictions vs actual revenue using Matplotlib & Seaborn

⚙️ Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

📁 Dataset

The dataset contains historical sales data, product information, seasonal factors, and other business-related features that influence revenue. It was used to train and evaluate predictive models.

💡 Insights & Findings

Identified key factors that strongly impact revenue

Seasonal trends and promotions significantly influence revenue peaks

Machine learning models provide reliable forecasts for business planning

🚀 Future Enhancements

Implement Time Series Forecasting using ARIMA or LSTM for better accuracy

Integrate with a dashboard for real-time revenue prediction

Test additional models and feature selection techniques for performance improvement
